Well, they all have a name and age. We also know that most dogs sit and roll over. Those two pieces of information (name and age) and those two behaviors (sit and roll over) will go in our Dog class because they’re common to most dogs. This class will tell Python how to make an object representing a dog. After our class is written, we’ll use it to make individual instances, each of which represents one specific dog."
